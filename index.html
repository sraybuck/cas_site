                <h2>Customer Testimonials</h2>

                <p>"My husband and I are college and law school graduates---Darla is the reassurance that we need as we navigate through the college application process with our children.  Starting in 8th grade with course selection, Darla has guided our children with professional insight and tailor-made plans for individual success."</p>

                <p>-Holly Weiss</p>

                <p> "Working with Darla was one of the best decisions we could have made!  Starting in 10th grade, Darla educated my daughters on ways to organize their resumes and select activities that were meaningful.  With periodic meetings, she guided my girls through ACT/SAT testing timelines and suggested ways to improve scores.  Darla was a wealth of knowledge about universities that we may not have considered.  She was a mentor and a cheerleader and took so much anxiety out of an otherwise stressful process.  And under her direction, both of my daughters were accepted into their 1st choice universities!"</p>

                <p>-Linnea Jackson</p>

                <p>"She was professional, very knowledgeable, and always optimistic. My son really enjoyed working with her. Darla took the time to find out what HE was looking for and then helped formulate a plan of how to achieve his specific goals. I would highly recommend Darla Neal to assist your son or daughter with their college goals."</p>

                <p>-Marohn and Nick Pacitti</p>

                <p>"I highly recommend Darla’s services. She took the stress off of me to monitor applications and deadlines and worked very well with my teen. She gave some great insight into the schools we were looking at.  My daughter got in her school of choice and received scholarships from each school she was accepted at."</p>

                <p>-Vickie and John Andrews</p>

                <p>"Darla was extremely helpful in my MBA essay development, review and interview preparation. She  helped me distinguish my competitive advantages as a candidate and person. I believe that Darla helped bring out the best in me on paper. Throughout my MBA recruiting process, I was comforted by the fact that Darla was just a phone call or email away.  She gave me amazing guidance and support from the start of the recruiting process to the very end which lead to pursue my MBA at Owen’s graduate school of Management, Vanderbilt University. It really was such a pleasure to work with Darla!"</p>
