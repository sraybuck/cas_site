            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>College Admissions Services, LLC was created in the spring of 2010 by Darla Neal. Darla’s corporate experience was a natural transition to comprehending the college admissions process.

Our mission is to work with students and parents within St. Johns and Duval counties to identify schools that match the student's academic and social interests and then guide both students and parents through the entire application process: resume, essay, application and scholarships. Both Darla and Kim are members of Southern Association for College Admission Counseling and Independent Educational Consultants Association, nationally recognized organizations for college counseling.</p>

                <h2>Customer Testimonials</h2>

                <p>"My husband and I are college and law school graduates---Darla is the reassurance that we need as we navigate through the college application process with our children.  Starting in 8th grade with course selection, Darla has guided our children with professional insight and tailor-made plans for individual success."</p>

                <p>-Holly Weiss</p>

                <p>"We asked Kim to help with the college essay. Kim went above and beyond to help her bring it all together. Our daughter felt so comfortable with Kim that she asked her to look over all her applications. As a parent, I thought we didn’t need any help but each child is different and she felt more comfortable working through this process with Kim. I wish we had started with Kim earlier."</p>

                <p>-Ruth Murta</p>

                <p> "Working with Darla was one of the best decisions we could have made!  Starting in 10th grade, Darla educated my daughters on ways to organize their resumes and select activities that were meaningful.  With periodic meetings, she guided my girls through ACT/SAT testing timelines and suggested ways to improve scores.  Darla was a wealth of knowledge about universities that we may not have considered.  She was a mentor and a cheerleader and took so much anxiety out of an otherwise stressful process.  And under her direction, both of my daughters were accepted into their 1st choice universities!"</p>

                <p>-Linnea Jackson</p>

                <p>"Kim is certainly one of the bright points in an otherwise stressful college admission process, bringing with her a wealth of knowledge and a cheerfulness that is very welcome. Our son wanted to do all his applications on his own. Kim was amazingly perceptive of this and very artfully guided him, helping him refine his resume and unearth valuable information crucial to the application process. What is endearing about Kim is that she treated him like he was her own, working tirelessly to help him achieve his goals, while respecting his independence. His success in the admission process is testament to her skill. We would highly recommend Kim to any high school parent in a heartbeat."</p>

                <p>-Amrita Bhargava</p>

                <p>"I highly recommend Darla’s services. She took the stress off of me to monitor applications and deadlines and worked very well with my teen. She gave some great insight into the schools we were looking at.  My daughter got in her school of choice and received scholarships from each school she was accepted at."</p>
