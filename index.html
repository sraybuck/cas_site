                <h2>Customer Testimonials</h2>

                <p>"Darla Neal has been an incredible college counselor to our family. With my older son she has not only helped guide him in his path to the right colleges but also in the entire start to finish application process. She has such an amazing way of guiding him to get the deadlines done and guide him in his decision-making process. I really have to say it’s the best decision I made to hire Darla to help us with this complicated process. She has been working with us for 3 1/2 years now and it’s been 100% beneficial. It’s also helped me get rid of the struggles between me and my sons of what classes to take, what colleges to apply to and how to apply and keeping up with deadlines. She has also helped us tremendously with my sophomore in guiding him on summer programs, classes and how to achieve his goals for college. We can’t thank her enough and appreciate everything she has done for our family."</p>

                <p>-Mona Shah, MD (Atlantic Coast HS)</p>

                <p>"Darla helped three of my children through the college admission process by keeping them on track, organized and focused on getting into the schools they wanted to.  She also explained options and possibilities that weren’t on their radar prior.  She knows so much about different universities and the application process in general.  She helped us cruise the process with little stress and motivated my kids to do what they needed to do to stand out to admissions officers.  She was valuable and inspiring to my kids during this crazy transition period in their lives and I don’t know what I would’ve done without her."</p>

                <p>-Laura Duffy (Ponte Vedra HS)</p>

                <p> "Darla takes the anxiety out of the college admissions process and replaces it with confidence.  She breaks the process down into smaller deadlines and before you know it you’re done. She offers valuable insight into options you may not have otherwise considered.  We are so grateful that we had her help and plan on using her for our other daughter."</p>

                <p>-Cindy Brubaker (Mandarin HS)</p>

                <p>"I used Darla initially for my son six years ago. I was pleased with the guidance and support she gave my son that I returned to her six years later to help my daughter. Darla listens to the student's college preferences and guides them carefully based on the individual student's strengths.  Darla keeps the student focused on deadlines and other relevant matters associated with the complicated college application process.  Based on this personal attention, my daughter applied to some of her initial choices but, was also made aware of some other great campuses based on her interests."</p>

                <p>-Sharon Buttner (Paxon HS)</p>

                <p>"Darla guides you and your child every step of the way through the process. She works directly with your child to make sure that their best self is reflected in their applications. She sets clear expectations and deadlines that will keep your child on task. What a huge help in the midst of the craziness that is the college application process!"</p>

                <p>-Gina Donahoo (Episcopal School of Jacksonville)</p>

                <p>"I cannot imagine having waded through all the overwhelming College information without an expert in the field.  The worry about how much I didn't know was really weighing me down as a busy working mom of a senior. As if the thought of them simply going to college isn’t enough to deal with.  Darla was heaven sent.  She is organized, efficient, incredibly knowledgeable in her field and I simply don’t know what we would have done without her. While I attended almost every one of their appointments my daughter and Darla did practically all the heavy lifting.  Darla not only helped with all the technical concerns about application deadlines, how to gather the necessary information, how to find tutors if necessary, but she even more importantly was able to help guide my daughter to consider schools that she thought would be a good fit! Save yourself, call Darla."</p>

                <p>-Lisa Menton (Douglas Anderson HS)</p>

                <p>"Our daughter Livi began working with Mrs. Neal as a ninth-grade student and her counsel and support helped Livi over the 4 years to confidently enter the college admissions process. Mrs. Neal was extremely knowledgeable about the Ponte Vedra High School Curriculum which helped Livi to plan her 4 years so that in the end she could apply to Universities with competitive Architecture degree programs. She took us step by step through the intricacies of each application and guided us toward various scholarship opportunities. She will be on my short list to call when Livi is accepted to college! We could not have done it without her!"</p>
